/* Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers - Intermediate Algorithm Scripting - freeCodeCamp

Instructions
-------
Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num.
The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.
For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 5.

function sumFibs(num) {
  return num;
}

sumFibs(4);

/* Test Cases

sumFibs(1) should return a number.
sumFibs(1000) should return 1785.
sumFibs(4000000) should return 4613732.
sumFibs(4) should return 5.
sumFibs(75024) should return 60696.
sumFibs(75025) should return 135721.
